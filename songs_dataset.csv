871,Alligatoah,TRAUERFEIER LIED,part i,E C#m A B E C#m A B E C#m A B A C#m A C#m A C#m A B,Und ich gab jedem Trauerfeier Lied diesselbe Chance. Keins war genug monumental und herzzerreißend von Queen bis Elton John. Diesen Hafensängern überlasse ich doch nicht die Show auf meiner großen Todesfeier hier der Song vom Zeremonienmeister. Das Fest beginnt ich stell es mir gigantisch vor ich hoffe doch ihr habt mir einen Elefant besorgt. Ich seh prasselnden Regen in der Masse fließen Tränen. Kinderaugen fragen wann sie Papa wiedersehen. Es gibt noch Fotos da kann man mich in kraftbepackter Pracht betrachten. Ich hab auch T-Shirts und Kaffeetassen machen lassen.  80 Tacken die Bestattungskasse schluckt. Wer keins mehr kriegt kann auch wahrscheinlich Bilder meiner straffen Brust auf allen privaten und offenen Kanälen und Blogs und in jeglichem Wochenblatt sehen. Ich geh mal davon aus das das geklappt hat mit meiner Modelkarriere. Trotzdem danke für das zahlreiche Erscheinen aber ja nicht streiten etwas Wartezeit und jeder darf sich vor dem Sarg verneigen.  ,hiphop
872,Alligatoah,TRAUERFEIER LIED,refrain,E C#m A B E C#m A B E C#m A B E C#m A B A E B C#m B C#m,"Ihr schafft den Rest allein. Wem ist heute keine Träne in die Hände geflossen? Ihr schafft den Rest allein. Der ist ein schlechter Mensch und wird von Engeln erschossen. Ihr schafft den Rest allein. Doch es wird wieder alles gut. Ihr schafft den Rest allein. Denn ihr hört dieses Lied im Loop. Und meine letzten Worte bevor ich zu den Sternen schweb: ""Gern geschehen."".  ",hiphop
873,Alligatoah,TRAUERFEIER LIED,part ii,E C#m A B A C#m A C#m A C#m A B, Hört ihr den Wind in den Bäumen singen? Ich werde euch den Weg weisen. Ich bin hier oben über euch wie schon zu Lebzeiten. Dir holde Maid bin ich ein Schutzengel im Wolkenreich. Wenn du jemand andern fickst dann werd ich eher Poltergeist. Jungs ich werd euch auch fehlen oder? Denkt daran das ich euch stets mein Haustelefon gab. Soviel gute Taten alter so war schon der Bäcker im Dorf. Meinte wenn ich weg bin ist die Welt ein besserer Ort. Ihr schafft den Rest allein also die Drecksarbeit. Son Mausoleum bleibt nicht von alleine fleckenfrei. Und rächt meinen Mord doch schafft euch Heimvorteil. Wenn er mich besiegt hat muss er ein Cyborg sein. Hab mittlerweile mir bestimmt ne Religion zugelegt um so gut es geht der Angst vor dem Tod souverän zu entgehen. Hab nie großspurig Hochmut gelebt doch Paradiese reißen sich um mich Losbudenmäßig. Eyyyy.  ,hiphop
874,Alligatoah,TRAUERFEIER LIED,refrain,E C#m A B A E B C#m A E B C#m A E B C#m A E B C#m E C#m A B, Orchester. Piano. Feuerzeuge. Gesangstalent. Und meine letzten Worte bevor ich zu den Sternen schweb man mich in Särge legt und in die Erde gräbt. Ich hab dir mehr gegeben als dein Wert beträgt. Wir wollen nicht Erbsen zählen. Gern geschehen.   Und ich gab jedem Trauerfeier Lied diesselbe Chance. Keine Musikkapelle konnt mich überzeugen also schrieb ich schnell und prompt. Denn falls ich nie mit Nachwuchs zu meinen Schwiegereltern komm dann hinterlass ich lieber dieser Welt nen Song.  Fin.  By Kampfgorilla_94,hiphop
